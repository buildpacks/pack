    "body": "# pack v0.11.2\r\n> This is a **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI. This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice. Note that pack is intended for local image builds, and thus requires a Docker daemon. The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n#### macOS\r\n\r\nIf you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install buildpacks/tap/pack\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\nOn Linux you can use the one of the following methods of installation.\r\n\r\n##### Arch Linux\r\n\r\n- [pack-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pack-cli/)\r\n- [pack-cli-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pack-cli-bin/)\r\n\r\n##### Command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(export GH=buildpacks/pack; export LATEST=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$GH/releases/latest | grep -o -E \"https://.+?-linux.tgz\"); echo \"$LATEST\"; curl -sSL \"$LATEST\" | sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin/ --no-same-owner -xzv $(basename $GH))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n\r\n1. Download the `.tgz` or `.zip` file for your platform\r\n2. Extract the `pack` binary\r\n3. (Optional) Add the directory containing `pack` to `PATH`, or copy `pack` to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  rebase                Rebase app image with latest run image\r\n  inspect-image         Show information about a built image\r\n  set-run-image-mirrors Set mirrors to other repositories for a given run image\r\n  set-default-builder   Set default builder used by other commands\r\n  inspect-builder       Show information about a builder\r\n  suggest-builders      Display list of recommended builders\r\n  trust-builder         Trust builder\r\n  create-builder        Create builder image\r\n  package-buildpack     Package buildpack in OCI format.\r\n  suggest-stacks        Display list of recommended stacks\r\n  version               Show current 'pack' version\r\n  report                Display useful information for reporting an issue\r\n  completion            Outputs completion script location\r\n  help                  Help about any command\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help         Help for 'pack'\r\n      --no-color     Disable color output\r\n  -q, --quiet        Show less output\r\n      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output\r\n  -v, --verbose      Show more output\r\n      --version      Show current 'pack' version\r\n\r\nUse \"pack [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Info\r\n\r\nBuilders created with this release of the pack CLI continue to contain [lifecycle v0.7.5](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.7.5) by default.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n* Use lifecycle image instead of builder when exporting to daemon and builder is untrusted (#684)"
