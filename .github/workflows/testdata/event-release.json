    "body": "# pack v0.10.0\r\n> This is a **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI. This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice. Note that pack is intended for local image builds, and thus requires a Docker daemon. The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nIf you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install buildpacks/tap/pack\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n\r\n1. Download the `.tgz` or `.zip` file for your platform\r\n2. Extract the `pack` binary\r\n3. (Optional) Add the directory containing `pack` to `PATH`, or copy `pack` to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  rebase                Rebase app image with latest run image\r\n  inspect-image         Show information about a built image\r\n  create-builder        Create builder image\r\n  package-buildpack     Package buildpack in OCI format.\r\n  set-run-image-mirrors Set mirrors to other repositories for a given run image\r\n  inspect-builder       Show information about a builder\r\n  set-default-builder   Set default builder used by other commands\r\n  suggest-builders      Display list of recommended builders\r\n  suggest-stacks        Display list of recommended stacks\r\n  version               Show current 'pack' version\r\n  report                Display useful information for reporting an issue\r\n  completion            Outputs completion script location\r\n  help                  Help about any command\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help         Help for 'pack'\r\n      --no-color     Disable color output\r\n  -q, --quiet        Show less output\r\n      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output\r\n  -v, --verbose      Show more output\r\n      --version      Show current 'pack' version\r\n\r\nUse \"pack [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Info\r\n\r\nBuilders created with this release of the `pack` will  contain [lifecycle v0.7.2](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.7.2) by default.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Volumes provided via `pack build --volume` are now accessible during phase detect. (#526)\r\n- `pack create-package` can output a `.cnb` file via `--format=file`. (#536)\r\n- `pack build --buildpack` supports `.cnb` file.  (#563)\r\n- `pack build` accepts a `--default-process` flag to set the default process type on app image. (#546)\r\n- Include and exclude feature of the `package.toml` extension is now supported. (#511)\r\n- Contents of `builder.toml` for `pack create-builder` are now validated. (#510)\r\n- Added support for buildpack `homepage`. (#506)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- `pack` binaries are now noticeably smaller. (#527)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- `pack` will pass new flag `-run-image` instead of `image` to the lifecycle as part of Platform API 0.3. (#560)"
